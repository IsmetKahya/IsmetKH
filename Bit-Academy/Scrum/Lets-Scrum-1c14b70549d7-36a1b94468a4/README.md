# SCRUM-Web-Shop
SCRUM-Web-Shop is a web shop project where users can easily browse and purchase their desired clothing products. This project was developed as a school assignment to demonstrate the team’s understanding and practical application of the SCRUM methodology.

Users can explore products through various category pages such as the men’s page, women’s page, and shoes page. The platform provides convenient filtering and sorting options to help users quickly find the products they want. Selected items can be added to the shopping cart and purchased seamlessly.

Additionally, an admin panel allows administrators to securely edit or remove products, ensuring the product catalog remains up-to-date and well-maintained.

To get started with the project, you can clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:
git clone git@github.com:Aimal-Amiri/SCRUM-Web-Shop.git
